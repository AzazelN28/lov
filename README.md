# Legends of Valour

Excerpt from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_Valour):

> Legends of Valour is a role-playing video game developed by Synthetic Dimensions and released by U.S. Gold and Strategic Simulations in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS, with the additional FM Towns and PC-98 versions in 1993-1994 in Japan only (as Legends of Valour: Gouyuu no Densetsu[1]). As the game was planned to be a first part of the series, its full title is Legends of Valour: Volume I â€“ The Dawning. The proposed unreleased sequel to Legends of Valour was to take place in the world outside Mitteldorf, the enclosed city where the entirety of Legends of Valour takes place.
